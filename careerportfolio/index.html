        <p1>Aspiring Web Developer/Software Engineer
            Brigham Young University Idaho - Bachelors of Web Design and Development 2020-2024
            Conservice - PayCor Assistant Team Lead
            Projects completed in:
            Python
            HTML/CSS
            C#
            Javascript
            At work I have loved using google sheets to automate tasks and design sheets for my teams to use. I have really enjoyed making sheets that are organized, simple, visually appealing, and I have received positive feedback from several team members for the sheets I have made, nearly all of them are still being used today. I have also loved doing data tracking for team stats and workloads and have used several functions and even some scripts to improve our teamâ€™s work. Over a year after getting better at using formulas and designing sheets I want a bigger scope in which to use these skills. I have taken several programming classes and want my next step to be that of an associate software engineer.
